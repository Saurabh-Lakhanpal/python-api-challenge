### Temperature 
The max temperature appears show a strong negative linear relationship with latitudes in the northern hemisphere, with an r-value of -0.74. The max temperature appears show a strong positive linear relationship with latitudes in the southern hemisphere, with an r-value of 0.46.</br>
By viewing the graphs above, we can see that Latitude and Max Temperature have a clear co-relation. For both Hemisphere it is clear to see that as we approach 0 Latitude (equator) the Max Temperature increases, and the further away from 0 Latitude we go the Max Temperature will decrease.

### Humidity
The data seems to show that the lower the latitude, the less the humidity in both southern and northern hemispheres.</br>
By viewing the graphs above, we can see that Latitude and Humidity have almost no relationship to view. In the northern Hemisphere there is a greater correlation, how ever in the southern we can see that the r-value is nearly zero, implying that there is no linear association between Latitude and Humidity.

### Cloudiness
The data seems to show that the higher the latitude, the more cloudy it gets in the northern hemisphere. The data seems to show no relationship between cloudiness and latitude for the southern hemisphere.</br>
By viewing the graphs above, we can see that Latitude and Cloudiness have almost no relationship to speak of. Compared to Latitude and Humidity, we can see that these 2 graphs have a similar r-value of ~0.2, this shows that there is a slight correlation but nothing large enough to consider usable.

### Wind Speed
The data seems to show no relationship between wind speed and latitude for both the northern and southern Hemisphere.</br>
By viewing the graphs above, we can see that Latitude and Cloudiness have literally no relationship to speak of whatsoever. Both the northern and southern hemispheres show that there is no change in wind speed as we get closer to or further away from 0 Latitude. They both have r-values of ~0.1 showing that these variables have basically no correlation.
