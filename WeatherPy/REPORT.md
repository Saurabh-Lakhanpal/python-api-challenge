## Temperature 
The max temperature appears show a strong negative linear relationship with latitudes in the northern hemisphere, with an r-value of -0.74. The max temperature appears show a strong positive linear relationship with latitudes in the southern hemisphere, with an r-value of 0.46.
By viewing the graphs above, we can see that Latitude and Max Temperature have a clear co-relation. For both hemispheres it is clear to see that as we approach 0 Latitude (equator) the Max Temperature increases, and the further away from 0 Latitude we go the Max Temperature will decrease.
